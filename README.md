For now, data are stored using `localStorage`. Full mobile compatibility & Sync
are in the pipe.

**This is WiP, don't use it yet.**

-------

Install Kept dependencies:

    $ npm install

To launch a local server with live reload:

    $ npm start

Point your browser at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and start hacking
Kept files, a rebuild will be performed automatically in the background.

To build an optimized version of Kept:

    $ npm run dist

The resulting files are then available in the `build` folder.
